## Introduction to LSTMs
LSTMs are a type of RNN that are designed to remember information for long periods of time. They are designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that plagues traditional RNNs.

##Fake News Detection
This is a project that uses LSTMs to detect fake news. The dataset used is from kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/monal007/traindata)

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- gensim
- tensorflow
- keras

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the code using `python main.py` after downloading the dataset and placing it in the data folder

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of around 90% on the test set
